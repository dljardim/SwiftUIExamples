 Questions:
 Why doesnâ€™t count update when tapping the button?
 structs are immutable in swift. We need to use @State or @StateObjects to reatain their values.
 
 CounterView view is recreated every time the view updates
 ---
 How would you fix it? (Modify the code)
 ---
 What happens if you replace @State with let?
  - let marks the variable as a constant - error
  - removing @State means the count will not be retained
 
 ---
 ðŸ§  Mini Quiz (No Code Yetâ€”Just Answer)
 What happens if you remove @State but keep var count = 0 instead of let?
 -  Count will be recreated to 0 every time the view updates menaing "Count: 0" will always be displayed
 
 Why is @State private instead of @State public?
 private restricts access to the variable to only this view.
 
 If we want to modify count from another view, what should we use instead of @State?
 @StateObject
 ObserableObject protocol
 @Published var count
 
 mvvm where our mo
 add ObservableObject
